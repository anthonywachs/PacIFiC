*  How to compile Grains  *
***************************

We assume that you are using the standard gcc compiler.

Compiling Grains is a quick 3-step process:

1. Modify the "xerces_for_grains.env" file to export the XERCESCROOT variable,
i.e. change XERCESCROOT to the right location on your own machine or server. 

2. Depending on your gcc version and machine type (32 or 64 bits), you will first
need to export a few additional variables. To do this, select the environment 
file corresponding to your architecture.
In this file, adapt GRAINSROOT and GRAINSHOME to your own machine. 
Then source this file. For instance, if you are using gcc-4.1.2 in 64 bits, do:
	source grains-64bits-gcc-4.1.2.env

3. Simply compile the code using
	gmake
	
As a result, object, library and executable files are created in the
corresponding directories.

Is this OK ? 
If yes, let's use Grains and have fun :-)
