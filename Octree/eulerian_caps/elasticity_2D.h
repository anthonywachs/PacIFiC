# Eulerian elasticity

In this file we define and advect the tensors that track the elongation of a
region of space $\Gamma$ occupied by an elastic solid. It is meant to be
combined with [capsule.h](capsule.h) to provide a description of biological
membranes.

It was shown by [BarthÃ¨s-Biesel and Rallison](#berthes1981time) that the stress
tensor of an elastic membrane can be described in an Eulerian fashion with the
left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor $\bm{B}$ and the local projector onto the
membrane $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{n}\mathbf{n}$, with
$\mathbf{n}$ denoting the interface unit normal vector.

Recently, it was demonstrated by [Ii et al.](#ii2012full) that this
Eulerian expression of the stress tensor can be successfully implemented in order to
simulate elastic capsules without meshing their membrane and without requiring a
boundary-fitted fluid mesh or an immersed boundary method (IBM). They report
that it is more stable to advect the *modified* left Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor $\mathbf{G} = J^{-1}\mathbf{B}$, where
$J = \sqrt{(tr(\mathbf{B})^2 - tr(\mathbf{B}^2))/2}$ is the surface Jacobian
of the membrane, i.e. the local membrane area change [](#ii2012computational).

Both $J$ and $\mathbf{G}$ are only defined in the capsule region $\Gamma$, and
in this region they follow the advection equations:

$$ \partial_t J + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla J = (\nabla_s \cdot \mathbf{u}) J $$
$$ \partial_t \mathbf{G} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{G} =
\mathbf{G} \cdot \nabla_s \mathbf{u} +  (\nabla_s \mathbf{u})^T \cdot \mathbf{G}
- (\nabla_s \cdot \mathbf{u}) \mathbf{G}
$$
$$\text{with} \quad \nabla_s = \mathbf{P} \cdot \nabla$$
denoting by $\mathbf{n}$ the interface normal, $\nabla_s$ the surface gradient and
$\nabla_s \cdot$ the surface divergence.

/**
We have the option of defining a pre-inflated capsule by setting $J_0$ to a
value greater than 1. By default, there is no stress on the capsule in the
reference configuration.

/**
When the membrane region moves and a cell becomes part of the membrane, it needs
to have some initialized values for the Eulerian quantities $\mathbf{G}$ and
$J$. Therefore we create a layer of membrane cells that will be initialized to
the average values of its neighbouring cells already belonging to the membrane.
When the default BCG advection scheme is used, we need this layer of initialized
cells to have a thickness of $2 \Delta$ for a proper computation of fluxes.
